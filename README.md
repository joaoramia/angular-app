Test Angular-app, using require.js to load its resources.

Please run npm install for the server to be able to run on npm start.

The idea behind this app was to create a way to organize your foreign currencies and plans, along with a contact list per currency (Europeans are divided in the EUR, Americans in the USD and Brazilians in the BRL).

Hope you like it,
